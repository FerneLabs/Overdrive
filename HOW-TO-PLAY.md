# Overdrive - How to play
## The goal in Overdrive is to reach 100 points before your oponent, you can achieve this by hacking ciphers in your control console and combining them into modules to affect the state of the race.

There are 4 diferent type of ciphers:
- **Advance**: increases your progression in the race
- **Attack**: decreases the opponent progression in the race
- **Defense**: creates a shield to  protect yourself from attacks
- **nergy**: replenish your energy

In order to hack ciphers, one needs energy, which is regenerated over time, or obtained by creating energy modules with the energy type ciphers.

You can also save ciphers in your reserve for later use.

The main flow of the game is as follows:
- Hack ciphers using energy.
- Combine 2 or more ciphers of the same type into system modules.
- If a module is created with 3 ciphers of the same type, a x2 multiplier is applied to the module value.

Use the right timing, cipher storing in your reserve, and module type combination to get an advantage over theÂ opponent.
