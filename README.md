# Overdrive
A Web3 Racing Game

## TLDR

Overdrive aims to revolutionize the casual Web3 gaming space by offering a fun, accessible, and strategic experience with non-invasive monetization. Its integration on Starknet and focus on an NFT-based economy will attract both casual gamers and blockchain enthusiasts.

## What is Overdrive?

Overdrive is a fully on-chain racing game developed on the Starknet blockchain, combining real-time racing mechanics with strategic power-ups and a blockchain-based economy. The game offers a seamless, engaging experience for both crypto and non-crypto players, allowing them to compete in exciting races without needing prior blockchain knowledge.

### Value Proposition

- Accessibility to a wide audience
- Integration of real-time strategy in races
- Easy-to-play, fun mechanics
- Security and transparency of blockchain technology

## Why?

Our goal with Overdrive is to bring a fresh take on racing games by combining real-time strategy with fast-paced action in an entirely on-chain format. Developed on StarkNet, Overdrive ensures that players, whether crypto enthusiasts or newcomers, can jump into competitive racing without needing prior blockchain experience. Through strategic use of ciphers and blockchain-integrated rewards, Overdrive offers an engaging and accessible racing experience.

## How?

Overdrive leverages Cairo and Dojo Engine to build secure and efficient smart contracts for managing game logic and interactions. Unity is used as the game engine due to its powerful capabilities and the team's experience, delivering smooth, high-quality graphics. The StarkNet blockchain is crucial in providing fast, low-cost transactions while supporting the integration of NFTs that represent digital assets such as car customizations.

## Key Mechanics

### Real-Time Power-ups

### A 2D game, a 3D experience

Overdrive combines 3D models with a 2D camera view and an organic parallax background effect, ensuring smooth performance on mobile and desktop browsers while processing all transactions on-chain.

### Competition and Strategy

1v1 races where players use different cipher combinations strategically to secure victory. Timing and strategy is critical for maximizing effectiveness.

## Monetization Plans

### NFT Car Customizations

Players will be able to buy, trade, and sell cars NFTs representing both cosmetics and match buffs customizations, ensuring fair and diverse competition while also generating revenue.
